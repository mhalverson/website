I love tramping, or as it's known in the USA, backpacking. Having visited a
fair number of New Zealand backcountry huts, I became curious about which huts
I've visited (and which ones I haven't). Naturally, it was time for a data
visualization project!

After much hemming and hawing, I settled on building maps and a checklist:

* South Island hut map: [link](./tramping/south_island_hut_map.html)
* Checklist: [link](./tramping/hut_checklist.html)

Many thanks to DOC and the New Zealand government for making the hut data
freely available at <https://catalogue.data.govt.nz/dataset/doc-huts>.

If you want to make your own maps or checklist, the code is at
