title: Fourth of July
---

A week has passed since that most American of holidays: the Fourth of July,
sometimes known as Independence Day. We might as well take a leaf from Canada's
book and just call it what it is: America Day.

Living in New Zealand, where we are a day ahead of the USA, the 4th of July
passed without comment. On the 5th, however, three of my co-workers
independently wished me a happy Fourth of July. Two of them went on to remark
that there were no tanks in the streets of the capital... yet...

I laughed, in spite of myself. What a delightful coincidence to hear that exact
same sentence, twice. But, I'm left with the question: is there a meme I don't
know about?
