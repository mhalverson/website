title: Getting older
---

Our society has so many tropes about getting older: on the one hand, the
gradual degradation of the body or mind, loss of vitality, loneliness; on the
other hand, the utter lack of interest in what other people think of you, the
joy of connecting with younger generations, and wisdom.

As I live longer (at the time of writing, I am 31), I am discovering some
benefits of getting older that are outside the standard tropes.

The main one is the ability to think on larger timescales:

* I care more about history and its influence on the present, as well as the
  legacy my generation leaves for the future.

* I become more patient and remarkably more determined. Problems or setbacks
  that would have made me give up in failure in the past, I can now
  contextualise as surmountable obstacles that are just part of the journey.
  ("Progress is not a straight line".)

* I see the power of setting goals and checking progress against them, and of
  organising groups of people to achieve far more than I could achieve on my
  own.

None of these are groundbreaking, but it is one thing to say them and another
thing to know them in your bones.

Just be sure to come back to me in 10 years and ask me how I feel about
"getting older" :P (Seriously though, if you're not mildly embarrassed by
yourself from 10 years ago, are you really growing as a person?)
