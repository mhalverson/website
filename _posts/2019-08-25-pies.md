title: Pies

Yesterday marked the culmination of a multi-year baking project: I made every
pie in the cookbook First Prize Pies!

I was given the cookbook as a Christmas present in 2015, and thought it would
be fun to do a "year of pie" with the goal of making three pies per month
in 2016. I didn't quite hit the stated goal of 36 pies, but it was certainly a
success...  I made somewhere in the low 30s. By comparison, 2017 was a quiet
year for pie-making, in part due to wedding preparations. In 2018 Claire and I
did a [Great American
Roadtrip](../../../travel/2018_05_great_american_roadtrip.html) and the
pie-making picked up again: when we visited someone on the road, we usually
managed to make a pie as a thank you. Heading into 2019, I realised I was about
two-thirds of the way through the book, so I figured I should go ahead and make
the rest. Of course, by that time, we had moved to New Zealand, so some of the
ingredients were a little difficult to find (cornmeal, green tomatoes, Concord
grapes, etc)! But find them I did, with a little help from my friends.

As part of the Great American Roadtrip, we met up with the author of First
Prize Pies, Allison Kave, in Brooklyn. She very graciously took time out of her
workday to chat with us and sign the cookbook and we even got a selfie
together. (I tried to play it cool and not be overly excited, but I was
freaking out on the inside.)

I put together a photo collage to commemorate the end of the project:

It's not quite one photo per pie... there were two I forgot to take photos of
(Butterscotch Cream and Oatmeal Molasses). Otherwise, every pie is represented
in there at least once. Actually, I wrote a small [Python
program](https://github.com/mhalverson/pies) to randomly generate photo
collages, which was a fun side-project off the main project.

# Looking back

Overall, this was a fun, interesting, and of course tasty project!

I fell into the project unintentionally -- the idea of making everything in a
cookbook seemed really intimidating so I don't think I would have managed it as
an intentional goal.

One of the unexpected parts of making a lot of pies is that you make a lot of
people happy :) Pie is a simple pleasure and life needs more simple pleasures.

First Prize Pies is an excellent cookbook and I highly recommend it. Most of
the pies (50+ of the 75 total) were FANTASTIC. There are a few weird pies in
there; some of them were excellent (Avocado Cream, Elvis aka peanut
butter/banana/bacon, Malted Chess) and some were merely good, usually because I
thought they would be really weird and was then underwhelmed by how normal and
nice they were (Licoricious, Persimmon, Green Tomato, Root Beer Float). There
were only two duds that I straight up disliked (Melopita where I got the wrong
kind of cheese, and Oatmeal Molasses) which is pretty darn good out of 75 pies
total. 

I haven't decided if I'll set any more cookbook completionist goals. I'm no
longer intimidated by the idea; rather, it seems unlikely I'll find another
cookbook where I'm excited by such a high percentage of the recipes. I do plan
to heavily explore other cookbooks but I don't think I'll feel compelled to go
for 100%. But you never know. One of the joys of the project was the surprise
factor of finding out how tasty (or not) a pie was. I did not expect the vegan
pie to be one of my favourites!

Many thanks to Allison for writing the cookbook, Julie for gifting it to me,
and all my friends and family for helping eat the creations.

What's next? I am going to take a break from dessert pies, though I'll
definitely be making the highlights from First Prize Pies again. In the
meantime, I have two other cookbooks I'm excited to explore: Dinner Pies by Ken
Haedrich (are you really surprised?), and The Great New Zealand Baking Book.
Yum!
