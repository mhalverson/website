title: Trip report - Doubtful tops to Lake Man Biv
---

I had the pleasure of going for an overnight tramp on 23 April to Lake Man
Biv in Lewis Pass via the Doubtful Tops.

I went as a party of three. We parked the car just past Engineers Camp,
and anticipated a busy hut given all the cars we saw (plus the three day
weekend). We were wrong. The hut was empty and I can't recall seeing another
soul. But I get ahead of myself.

We crossed the river which was fine in low flows - the best crossing spot was
slightly upstream of the carpark. After gaining the river terrace, we meandered
up the valley for an hour or so, before veering off track to ascend to the
Doubtful tops at point 1258. It was a pretty easy ascent - steep for the first
few hundred vertical metres, but through mature beech forest, so the
understorey was quite open. It was comparatively gentle the rest of the ascent,
with somewhat dense scrub the last 100 m or so. It took about 2 hours from the
valley to the bushline.

Then we were on the tops! Travel was straightforward and the line was obvious.
There was a bit of wind and some looming clouds, but nothing to write home
about. I love tops travel.

We stopped at the marker post at Mt Murray, and wondered why it was the only
named peak despite not being the high point. A mystery for another day. We also
wondered at some of the placenames: Lake Man seems normal enough, but Mt Lake
Man seems a bit odd. Pussy Stream needs no commentary. And to have all of these
landmarks surrounded by the Hope and the Doubtful valleys? Too good to be true.

This was not my first trip to Lake Man Biv, and I had been looking forward to
actually visiting the lake this time, but it was not meant to be. We had such a
leisurely start (11 am river crossing) that we just made the hut before
nightfall (5:30 pm). At least I caught a glimpse of the lake from the Doubtful
tops (juuust visible in the below photo, if you zoom in).

We were surprised to have the hut to ourselves. It was a good thing as the tent
sites are pretty sparse. The stars were great until the rains set in.

The next morning we wandered back to the car via the conventional route,
following the track high above the Kedron River until we joined the main
Doubtful valley track. I am a sucker for mossy beech forests and I certainly
enjoyed that portion of the walk.

The track back to the car was wide open and rolled right along.

Doubtful Hut looked to be in better condition than last time I saw it, although
I still wouldn't want to camp there. The clearing in the trees just upvalley
looked like a much nicer campsite, except for the alarming numbers of
sandflies. We had lunch there but didn't dawdle.

It was a quick overnighter, but I quite enjoyed the route choice. It was a lot
of variety in a short amount of distance. I couldn't find any descriptions
online of the Doubtful Tops so I felt motivated to write this up. It was easy
and very enjoyable. Highly recommend! Just, if you want to go Lake Man (or Mt
Lake Man), leave a little earlier in the morning. It seems the more trips I do,
the longer my list gets. I still have some unfinished business here so I'm sure
I'll be back again!
