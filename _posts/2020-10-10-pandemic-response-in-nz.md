title: Pandemic Response in NZ
---

I was looking at my previous blog post on [Beekeeping in
NZ]({% post_url 2019-07-14-beekeeping-in-nz %})[^1] and realised that the government's
response to covid turned out to be very similar to its response to AFB in
beekeeping.

[^1]: Beekeeping update: I passed the AFB recognition test. Lost my first hive to varroa in the autumn. Have gotten another hive this spring - hopefully it fares better.

In both cases, the government set the lofty goal of eradication of a disease
(and has successfully achieved it twice so far in the case of covid). In both
cases, the government has imposed strict border controls to take advantage of
the island geography. Most important, in both cases, the government has been
supportive of its people: communications have been succinct, consistent, calm,
science-informed, and educational; legislation has been sensible and involves
minimal paperwork; the government stance is to help people affected by the
disease rather than punishing or shaming them.[^2]

[^2]: Unsurprisingly, the people affected by the disease have been subjected to nasty treatment by members of the public who are fearful and lash out. But at least the government has been supportive.
