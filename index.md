My name is Matt Halverson. I'm a software engineer (currently with
[IAG](https://www.iag.co.nz/)), a musician (currently with [Atlas
Voices](http://atlasvoices.nz/) and [Jubilate
Singers](https://www.jubilate.org.nz/)), and a traveler (most recently on a
[North Island roadtrip](./travel/2018_11_north_island_roadtrip.html)). I'm an
alum of [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/).
